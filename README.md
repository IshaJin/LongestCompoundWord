# LongestCompoundWord
1. *Break down words into prefixes and suffixes:*
   - We can create a data structure like a Trie to efficiently store and search for prefixes of words.
   - Each word in the list can be broken down into all its possible prefixes.

2. *Build candidate compound words:*
   - We can explore potential compound words by iteratively removing prefixes from longer words in the list.
   - For each prefix removal, the remaining suffix is treated as a potential candidate for being formed by concatenating shorter words.

3. *Validate candidate compound words:*
   - To verify if a suffix is a valid compound word, we need to check if it can be built by joining shorter words present in the original list.
   - The Trie data structure comes in handy here, as it allows us to efficiently search for prefixes of the suffix within the list.

4. *Track and compare lengths:*
   - As we explore candidate compound words, we need to keep track of the longest one found so far.
   - We can also optionally track the second longest compound word if desired.

5. *Iterative exploration:*
   - The process of removing prefixes and checking suffixes can be iterative. If a suffix can be formed by valid words, we can further explore its remaining parts after removing additional prefixes.
   - A queue data structure can be used to manage the exploration order of candidate compound words.

*How this approach leads to a solution:*

By systematically breaking down words into prefixes, checking if suffixes are valid using the Trie, and iteratively exploring potential compound words, this approach ensures that all possible combinations are considered. The tracking of the longest word length guarantees that the final result is indeed the longest compound word that can be formed from the given list.
